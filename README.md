# Embedded Wallet Migration

Focused on assisting users with the migration to Sequence wallets. This repository is designed to allow your users to view their NFTs and transfer them from a Thirdweb account to another wallet. Additionally, it provides functionality to switch between chains and view the native token balance. 

Quickstart
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill with your ThirdWeb project information:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill the .env.example with your VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID

Then install and run:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

The app will start on localhost:4444
